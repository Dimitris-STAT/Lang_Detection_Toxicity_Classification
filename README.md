# Regular Expressions Scraping and Language Detection Project

## Overview:
This project involves regular expressions scraping, language detection using regular expressions, and various related operations such as toxicity classification. The primary objectives include creating a language detector using regular expressions and performing additional tasks based on the detected language.

## Contents:
The project consists of the following components and functionalities:

### 1. Regular Expressions Scraping:
- Implementation of scraping techniques using regular expressions to extract relevant information from text data.

### 2. Language Detection:
- Creation of a language detector using regular expressions to identify the language of text data.

### 3. Additional Operations:
- Toxicity Classification: Classification of text data into toxic and non-toxic categories based on predefined criteria.
- Other Operations: Additional operations and analyses based on the detected language and text characteristics.
